# Assignment 2

## Question 1

Write your own MATLAB code to find the Histogram Equalized Image for any given image (i.e. “cameraman.tif”). Comment the code such that all the steps can be easily identified.

## Question 2

Write the Matlab code to perform averaging (smoothing) on an image (i.e.‘cameraman.tif’) using box filter.

i)	 Size of box filter: 3x3

ii)	 Size of box filter: 5x5

## Question 3

Write the Matlab code to perform median filtering for filter size 3x3 on any image (i.e.‘cameraman.tif’).
