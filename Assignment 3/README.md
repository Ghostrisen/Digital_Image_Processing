##Assignment 3
###Language: Matlab

##Question 1
###Write your own Matlab Code to compute gradient magnitude (apply sobel based convolution) of an image (i.e. “cameraman.tif”). Apply thresholding on gradient magnitude image to obtain edge image.  

##Question 2
###Read a color image in Matlab. Use RGB values of every pixel as feature and apply Segmentation using K-Mean clustering. K can be selected by user depending on the input image.

Note: Question 2 is only for GRAYSCALE images.
